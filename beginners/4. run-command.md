# Docker Run

```docker
> docker run redis # will run the redis container and the version will be the latest (tag latest).

> docker run redis:4.0 # will run the redis container of version 4.0 here 4.0 is TAG

> docker run -i containername  # it will run container interactive mode means if it is not interactive mode, it wont listen to any stdin and you could not provide input(or interactive) to the container start if any prompt written.

> docker run -it containername # in the above command, eventhough it is an interactive mode since it is not attached, it wont accept any prompt as well. we have  to interactive and attached to be communicated with the container.
```

## Run - port mapping:

![docker port map](../images/docker-port-map.jpg "Docker port map")

Consider an application ganku007/webapp, this application is running on a port 5000,

```docker
> docker run ganku007/webapp

# Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/  This is the output of the above command means it is running on port 5000.  So if we want to communicate with the app we have to do it via port 5000 via the container's IP address (this address is only accessible in docker host and not out  side of the host.) or we have to map the port 5000 (container port) ot one of the host's **free** ports so the outside world of docker host can access the container via docker host's port. We can run any number instances of the app via different docker host's ports but one port can be mapped to on instance.  

Below are the example,

> docker run -p 80:5000 ganku007/webapp

> docker run -p 8000:5000 ganku007/webapp

> docker run -p 8001:5000 ganku007/webapp

> docker run -p 3306:3306 mysql

> docker run -p 8306:3306 mysql
```
