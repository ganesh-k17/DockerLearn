# Docker - Images

## Why we have to create a new image


## How to create a new Image

While creating an image we have to clearly have an idea on how we are going to deploy the application. for example for deploying an flask application,

* OS - Ubuntu
* Update apt repo
* Install dependencies using apt
* Install Python dependencies using pip
* Copy source code to /opt folder
* Run the web server using "flask" command

We have to create a dockerfile based on the above steps,  In docker file everthing is in Instruction - Argument format,  all the Instructions are in caps  and the instructions may be some commands as below,

(FROM, RUN, COPY, ENTRYPOINT are example of INSTRUCTIONs),

```bash
Dockerfile

FROM Ubuntu
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install python

RUN pip install flask
RUN pip install flask-mysql

COPY . /opt/source-code

ENTRYPOINT FLASK_APP=/opt/source-code/app.py flask run

```

Then,

Build the docker file,

> docker build Dockerfile -t ganku007/myflask-app

this will create the image locally and we can make it available in public by pushing the image in public docker hub registry by specifying a name.
